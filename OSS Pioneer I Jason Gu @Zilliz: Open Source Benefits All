Welcome to the OSS Pioneer🌕 series of interviews featuring China's IT thought-leaders on all things Open Source.
For the 2nd interview, let's meet Jason Gu, Partner & Senior Architect @Zilliz👍, the open source infra software company behind Milvus.io, the highly scalable & blazing fast vector database for data scientists and AI developers.
Jason believes that the world could be engineered, and open source projects can disrupt the IT industry for the better.
He also shares his understanding that open source is not a business model, but more like a collaboration way, you build up a large user base through open source community promotion.
